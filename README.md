# Learning_cpp_with_NPTEL
This is a course from NPTEL(National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning, India) was conducted by IIT KHARAGPUR and instructed by Dr. Partha Pratim Das  a faculty in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. This course contains the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C) and also focuses on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems. On the way, it illustrates various OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) concepts.While this course can be understood independently (after a course in C programming), it would help in developing understanding in OOP. Hence this course is advised in conjunction with OOP.
